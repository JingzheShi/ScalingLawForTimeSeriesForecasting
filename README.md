# ScalingLawForTimeSeriesForecasting
The repository for experiment codes for our work *Scaling Law for Time Series Forecasting*. **Coming soon.**

This repository contains no new models or datasets. Instead, it contains codes like training scripts, and PCA analysis tools for time series that are used in our work.

We acknowledge the code bases provided by several previously proposed fantastic works, including [TimeSeriesLibrary](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library), [iTransformer](https://github.com/thuml/iTransformer), [ModernTCN](https://github.com/luodhhh/ModernTCN).
