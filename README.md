# ScalingLawForTimeSeriesForecasting
The repository for experiment codes for *Scaling Law for Time Series Forecasting*. **Coming soon.**

This repository contains no new models or datasets. Instead, it contains codes like training scripts and codes for PCA analysis for time series.

We acknowledge the code bases provided by several previously proposed fantastic works, including [TimeSeriesLibrary](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library), [iTransformer](https://github.com/thuml/iTransformer), [ModernTCN](https://github.com/luodhhh/ModernTCN).
